    \subsection{}
    %find the required caps for specified noise budget with provided SQNR
    What capacitance would be required at the input of the circuit shown in figure \ref{fig:difffirstorder} if the thermal noise is to consume 75\% of a noise budget that includes 5\% attributed to quantisation noise and the rest to other noise sources? The overall SNDR should be 100dB.

    \subsection{}
    %given the caps find the required switch resistance
    What switch resistance would be required to ensure that this circuit would settle in a 20ns clock phase?

    \subsection{}
    %then also find the amplifier gm and bias current required
    If the circuit must slew for 0.4V in 25\% of the clock period and then settle linearly from that point onwards within the 20ns clock phase, what bias current and amplifier $g_{m}$ are required?

%    \subsection{}
    %combine all the noises together at the end
    %wait, this makes no sense, because you already know what you're aiming for
