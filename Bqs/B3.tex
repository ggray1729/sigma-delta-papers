%applying Nth order equation
\begin{align}
    \text{SQNR} = 6.02N + (20L + 10)\log_{10}(OSR) - 10\log_{10}\left(\frac{\pi^{2L}}{2L+1}\right)
\end{align}

    \subsection{}
    % so the first step is easy
    Calculate the expected SQNR for a 3rd order modulator with an OSR of 64 and a 3-bit quantiser.

    %answer is 123.11dB

        \subsubsection{}

        Therefore, what is the expected ENOB?

        %ENOB = (SNDR-1.76)/6.02

    \subsection{}
    %Baseband noise voltage
    If the quantiser has a 1V full-scale signal amplitude what is the baseband noise voltage?

    \subsection{}
    %and something else?
    If the total noise contributions due to thermal noise sources equal $0.8\mu V$ RMS, and the signal amplitude of this circuit is 1V:
    %assume 1V amplitude signals?

        \subsubsection{}
        Is quantisation or thermal noise dominant?

        \subsubsection{}
        What is the expected SNDR of the circuit, ignoring any other noise sources?

        %sum in quadrature and then signal power over noise power logged
