%applying Nth order equation
\begin{align}
    \text{SQNR} = 6.02N + (20L + 10)\log_10(OSR) - 10\log_{10}\left(\frac{\pi^{2L}}{2L+1}\right)
\end{align}

    \subsection{}
    % so the first step is easy
    Calculate the expected SQNR for a 3rd order modulator with an OSR of 64 and a 3-bit quantiser.

        \subsubsection{}

        Therefore, what is the expected ENOB?


    \subsection{}
    %Baseband noise voltage
    If the quantiser has a 1V full-scale signal amplitude what is the baseband noise voltage?
