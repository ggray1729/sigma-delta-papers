%want this question to cover deriving the quantisation noise of a stndard quantiser
Given a uniform probability distribution between $\frac{-V_{LSB}}{2}$ and $\frac{V_{LSB}}{2}$ what is the power of quantisation noise in a standard quantiser?
\begin{align}
    P = \int_{\frac{-V_{LSB}}{2}}^{\frac{V_{LSB}}{2}} \rho V^{2} dV
\end{align}

% you could do this from memory and just say V_{SB}^{2}/12
